            <h2 class="featurette-heading">About Me:
                <span class="text-muted">A little bit about my life.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I was born in Xalapa, Veracruz Mexico. I'm fluent in both Spanish and English. My family moved from Mexico to the US when I was but a few months. I have spent almost the entirety of my life in Indiana.</p>
            <p class="lead">I currently attend Arsenal Technical High School. I'm in the Math and Science Magnet. I also take a computer science class within the Carrer Technology Center Magnet (CTC). Within my high school, I participate in many after school programs as well as the music department. I'm a manager for my school's wrestling team, I'm captain of The Academic Team/Brain Game. I'm also a member of Arsenal Tech's 4-H club, World Food Prize team, and Modle UN team. I play the violin in the advanced orchestra and have been playing since I was 7. I have participated in school musicals in either playing a role or playing in the pit.</p>
            <p class="lead">When it come to my interests outside of school, I am a very diverse person. I enjoy almost anything from watching sports like soccer and UFC fights with my dad and brothers to gardening with my mom to reading or do arts and crafts by myself. Most of my free time is spent reading or writing. I mingle more with the genres of horror and supernatural. My instrument also take up a lot of my time. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I started coding in my junior year of high school. At first, I didn't know what computer science was or how it impacted my community. Within the class, I learned not only the three basic coding languages but also what it takes to be a part of the growing tech field.</p>
            <p class="lead">I have participated the Hour of Code at the Indiana State House. I had the privilege to help Karen Pence through the One Hour of Code. Through my computer science class, I was able to participate in IUPUI's iDEW program. </p>
            <p class="lead">I look forward to incorporating my new found love for computer science into my everyday life.</p>
