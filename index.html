		<h3>About Me:</h3>
			<a href="views/stories.html"><img class="first-circle" src="img/bg5.gif"></a>
			<p>I was born in Xalapa, Veracruz Mexico. I'm fluent in both Spanish and English. My family moved from Mexico to the US when I was but a few months. I have spent almost the entirety of my life in Indiana.</p>
			<p>I currently attend Arsenal Technical High School. I'm in the Math and Science Magnet. I also take a computer science class within the Carrer Technology Center Magnet (CTC). Within my high school, I participate in many after school programs as well as the music department. I'm a manager for my school's wrestling team, I'm captain of The Academic Team/Brain Game. I'm also a member of Arsenal Tech's 4-H club, World Food Prize team, and Modle UN team. I play the violin in the advanced orchestra and have been playing since I was 7. I have participated in school musicals in either playing a role or playing in the pit.</p>
			<p>When it come to my interests outside of school, I am a very diverse person. I enjoy almost anything from watching sports like soccer and UFC fights with my dad and brothers to gardening with my mom to reading or arts and crafts by myself. Most of my free time is spent reading or writing. I mingle more with the genres of horror and supernatural. My instrument also take up a lot of my time. </p>

		<h3>:Why I do Coding</h3>
			<a href="views/coding.html"><img class="second-circle" src="img/bg4.gif"></a>
			<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then</p>
