    <h3 class="begin">Are you ready to face your fears?</h3>
    <p class="begin">In this game, you either live or die. To pick the correct answer you must read carefully. For your first choice, you need to be 'right' in order to live.</p>

<!--   Living Scenes -->
  <div id="scene1">
    <h3>Waking Up</h3>
    <p>A throbbing pain forced you out of a realm of sleep to a reality that you didn't remember. You now lay on a small bed. A fogged memory came into view. You saw the same room you are in but cleaned. The view soon vanished to revealed the opposite. The room seemed abandoned; small plants and decaying drywall. The room was pitiful.</p>
    <p>You stood up to see the ground was wet. The liquid was too thick to be water. You stumbled a bit as you walk to the door. The door was left ajar. You push it open.</p>
    <p>The door exposed a dark and damp hallway. Lights flicker. Both ends of the hallway seem empty.</p>
    <button id="firstLeft">Left</button>
    <button id="firstRight">Right</button>
  </div>
  <div id="scene2">
    <h3>Another door</h3>
    <p>You walk for a while. Snippets of memories swarmed your vison. You reached the end of this path. You are left with two doors. Both seem unused and rusted. </p>
    <p>One has dents that bring an image of an immense creature clawing its way out from the other side (left). The door held one finishing touch, an out of place "DO NOT ENTER" sign.</p>
    <p>The other door holds a small window (right). The window is broken. There is what seems to be fresh blood and flesh. You know not if it's human or not.</p>
    <button id="secondLeft">Left</button>
    <button id="secondRight">Right</button>
  </div>
  <div id="scene3">
    <h3>Hallway</h3>
    <p>The door leads you to a hallway lined with numerous doors. Each door possesses a small window and several locks. There is an awful stench coming from the doors, yet you are compelled to open them. Do you give in to the need or do you continue down the hallway into the emanating darkness?</p>
    <button id="thirdDoors">Enter</button>
    <button id="thirdStraight">Go Straight</button>
  </div>
  <div id="scene4">
    <h3>Last Option</h3>
    <p>The door led you into the main office. You can see the doors from the main entrance. To your left you notice a hall way towards the back exit. Which do you take?</p>
    <p>The hallway to the exit is short but dark. Yet the main entrance seems welcoming; bright and warm.</p>
    <p>Something inside pushes you to take the back exit. Are you one to follow your instincts or do you go against it? </p>
    <button id="fourthMain">Main Entrance</button>
    <button id="fourthBack">Back Exit</button>

  <div id="firstDeath">
    <h2>Old Friend</h2>
    <p>You walked for a while. You soon noticed a pair of purple glowing eyes. They held a longing for forgiveness as if it had commit sins that one shouldn't speak of.</p>
    <p>The creature hid its body within the darkness.</p>
    <p>You moved closer. You remembered those eyes, but they now were connected to something you didn't know. What had they done?</p>
    <p>Time was up, and you knew you couldn't out run you old friend in her new body. It was over.</p>
    <p>She leaped towards you, the longing in her eyes turned into hunger. You became the meal that she had waited for.</p>
