  <div id="scene1">
    <h3>Waking Up</h3>
    <p>A throbbing pain forced you out of a realm of sleep to a reality that you didn't remember. You now lay on a small bed. A fogged memory came into view. You saw the same room you are in but cleaned. The view soon vanished to revealed the opposite. The room seemed abandoned; small plants and decaying drywall. The room was pitiful.</p>
    <p>You stood up to see the ground was wet. The liquid was too thick to be water. You stumbled a bit as you walk to the door. The door was left ajar. You push it open.</p>
    <p>The door exposed a dark and damp hallway. Lights flicker. Both ends of the hallway seem empty.</p>
    <button id="firstLeft">Left</button>

  </div>
  <div id="scene2">
    <h3>Another door</h3>
    <p>You walk for a while. Snippets of memories swarmed your vison. You reached the end of this path. You are left with two doors. Both seem unused and rusted. </p>
    <p>One has dents that bring an image of an immense creature clawing its way out from the other side (left). The door held one finishing touch, an out of place "DO NOT ENTER" sign.</p>
    <p>The other door holds a small window (right). The window is broken. There is what seems to be fresh blood and flesh. You know not if it's human or not.</p>

  <div id="scene3">
    <h3>Hallway</h3>
    <p>The door leads you to a hallway lined with numerous doors. Each door possesses a small window and several locks. There is an awful stench coming from the doors, yet you are compelled to open them. Do you give in to the need or do you continue down the hallway into the emanating darkness?</p>
    <button id="thirdDoors">Enter</button>
    <button id="thirdStraight">Go Straight</button>
  </div>
  <div id="scene4">
    <h3>Last Option</h3>
    <p>The door led you into the main office. You can see the doors from the main entrance. To your left you notice a hall way towards the back exit. Which do you take?</p>
    <p>The hallway to the exit is short but dark. Yet the main entrance seems welcoming; bright and warm.</p>
    <p>Something inside pushes you to take the back exit. Are you one to follow your instincts or do you go against it? </p>

    <h2>Old Friend</h2>
    <p>Lights flicker in and out of existences as you make your way down the hallway. Creaks follow your footsteps but don't quite match up with you. You stop. The creaks continue for just a moment but long enough for you to notice it. Something is here with you. You look around aimlessly yet there is nothing to see.</p>
    <p>You start moving again but you hesitate. Where were you coming from? The ends seem to be an eternity away. There haven't been any turns either. You've entered its domain.</p>
    <p>There is something coming for you. You stand still. You can hear it coming. The lights start to flutter until one the one standing above you is left. You can feel its warm breath on your face however you can't see it. You stumble back and fall down.</p>
    <p>The light shines upon its face. You know that face don't you? Well, you did before it was changed. It's too late now. Despite knowing that, to moved closer. The eyes are what caught your attention. They hold such sadness and longing. </p>
    <p>Your train of thought is suddenly cut off as those eyes change abruptly. Any and all trace of humanity gone. They are cold and distant yet still hold a burning hunger. Within an instant, you feel a sharp pain in your shoulder. As it tears into your flesh you hear a voice. A soft whisper.</p>
    <p>"Forgive me, my love."</p>

    <h2>Hunger</h2>
      <p>As you pushed the door opened you feel a wetness on your hand. Red. It's blood. The door handle was covered in blood. You force yourself to push forward and open the door. You take a deep breath. You open your eyes. You didn't realize that you had closed them. You see nothing wrong. Just another room left in ruins. Taking a few steps into the room you hear something. A soft crunching, almost like chewing. </p>
      <p>You are left frozen. What have you walked into? You turn your head to meet the source of the noise. The room was dark but somehow that area seemed darker. This seems to be the end. The chewing stops. It can smell your sweat. A thought runs through your mind. 'Was someone else here? The blood on the door was still warm.' The thing that sat in the dark room rose.</p>
      <p>Eyes shine a yellow-green like a cat hunting under the new moon. As it came closer you saw more. You didn't dare to move. You knew that this was the end. It now stood no more than a yard away. It loomed over you. There was a new sound. Drip, drip, drip. I looked at the beasts arm. 'It was eating its arm.' You looked up to its eyes and smiled. Time was up. You knew that at least you satisfied its hunger. For now.</p>

    <h2>Him</h2>
    <p>Curiosity killed the cat you know. Yet you open the door. You couldn't help yourself, could you? Well, as you push open the door you relieved that it was harder than you originally thought. You push harder. Finally, something snaps and the door opens swiftly. The room is relatively small and there isn't much to see. You take a step into the dark room to get a better look. Nothing. It still looks awful but the theme fits. Padded wall discolored and shredded and scents that are anything except pleasant though that's what everything looks like. </p>
    <p>You turn to leave but something catches your eye. Something small and glistening gleams brightly near the right corner of the pitiful room. You're compelled to grab it. You walk further into the room. You bend over to collect that tiny piece of sunshine. SLAM! The door is suddenly shut forcefully. </p>
    <p>You don't bother turning around. A warm moist air slides over your neck and cheek. Violent shivers run through your body. You always said that if you had to die you wished to die quickly and quietly. I'm so sorry. I wish I say that's how you die but you see, he likes to play with is food. It's been so long since he's had a meal and he wants to make it last.</p>
    <p>You should have stayed out.</p>
